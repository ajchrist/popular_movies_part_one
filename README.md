# popular_movies_part_one
This is part one of two of the popular movies app for udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree program
This uses the themoviedb API, meaning you'll need your own API key if you want to use this source code.
Simply make the appropriate edits to Popular_movies/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/popular_movies/utilities/MovieNetworkUtil.java
And everything should work fine.
